To open vim editor directly : 
  vim filename.sh
  Press i to insert
  Write your code
  ESC + : + wq
  To run the file : . ./filename.sh

Steps to follow on opening terminal :
  cd /
  Cd mnt
  Cd c 
  And go to the directory you want to go.

Awk : 
  '/T/{print;}' data.txt - searches for ‘T’ in whole document and prints everything corresponding to it
  awk ‘ {print $1, $2}’ data.txt - prints 1 and 2 columns (we can put “\t” between 1 and 2 to provide indentation)
  awk 'NR==1,NR==2 {print ;}' data.txt - prints 1st and 2nd row (we can write NP after print to display the row number)
  awk ‘{print}’ data.txt - prints everything
  NF represents last column
  $0 prints whole file

LS or sl -a : very interesting
If else in terminal : if [ $1 -eq $2 ]
  > write
  >your
  >code
  >here
  >fi
This is equivalent to if else with ; . 

echo {1..3}{1..3}{1..3} prints all the permutations of 1,2,3.


for i in 1 2 3
do
	for j in 1 2 3
	do
		for k in 1 2 3
		do
			if [ $i -ne $j -a $j -ne $k -a $k -ne $i ]
			then
				echo "$i$j$k"
			fi
		done
	done
done
