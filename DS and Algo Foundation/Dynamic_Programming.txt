It is an optimization over recursion. Idea is to reuse the solutions of subproblems when there are two overlapping subproblems.
Ways to solve Dynamic Programming : -
1. Memoization (Top Down)
2. Tabulation (Bottom Up)

Memoization is easy to implement compared to Tabulation. Tabulation does not have overhead of recursion calls. 
  
Substring - pick all characters in continuos manner in same order.
Subsequence - pick some characters in same order, may not be contiguous.

The dimension of array will be number of parameters that change during recursion.
