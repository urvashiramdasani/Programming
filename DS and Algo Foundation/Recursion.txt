Recursion can be direct or indirect. In direct, the function directly calls itself. 
In indirect, the function fun1 calls another function fun2 which in turn calls fun1.

Some algorithms are recursive in nature - Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, Divide and Conquer, Tower or Hanoi, DFS.

Use sequnetial approach as shown in video to solve recurrences.

In tail recursion, the parent has got nothing to do when the child finishes its execution. It takes comparatively lesser time than head recursion.

In tail recursion, compilers completely remove the function call recursion with an expression and add a goto statement.
This is called tail call elimination.

Quick sort is faster than merge sort because it is tail recursion.

Inorder, Preorder - tail recursive. Post order traversal - non tail recursive.
