Recursion can be direct or indirect. In direct, the function directly calls itself. 
In indirect, the function fun1 calls another function fun2 which in turn calls fun1.

Some algorithms are recursive in nature - Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, Divide and Conquer, Tower or Hanoi, DFS.

Use sequnetial approach as shown in video.
