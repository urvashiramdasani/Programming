// Time Complexity - O(V + E) 
// E for traversing the list (Havel Hakimi theorem - sum of degrees of vertices is twice the number of edges)
// V for the case when all vertices are disconnected
// It is also used to find the connected components of a graph
// Applications - 1. Shortest path in unweighted graph  2. Crawlers in search engines  3. Peer to peer networks  4. Social networking search  5. Garbage collection
// 6. Cycle detection  7. Ford Fulkerson Algorithm (Maximum flow algorithm)  8. Broadcasting
